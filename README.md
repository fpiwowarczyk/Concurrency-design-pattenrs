### Notes 
Rob Pike - concurrency is not Parallelism  

World is not object oriented but parrallel. 

People at beggining in go used concurrent program run in multicore and had slower program. 

Concurrency is about dealing a lot of things at once. 

Parallelism is about doing a lot of things at once. 


## Advanced Go concurrency Patterns notes 

Go support concurrency in runtime not in library 

Channels and goroutines are cool
